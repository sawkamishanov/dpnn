## Data preprocessing for neural network training (project C06, ETU)

- According to the readings of the smartphone sensor, the vibrations of the device are collected during various types of activity. The task is to train the neural network on the received data.
- It is required to select a data filtering algorithm to improve the accuracy of neural network predictions.
- Retrain the neural network using the filtered data and compare the results.
